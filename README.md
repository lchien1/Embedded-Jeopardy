This repository uses the bare metal profile; if you need the full profile (see [here](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.16/bare-metal/index.html) for help deciding), open `mbed_app.json` and delete the line that says: `    "requires": ["bare-metal"],`.

This is a Jeopardy trivia game with an interactive hardware component. ![image](https://github.com/lchien1/Embedded-Jeopardy/assets/72617223/97368ef2-2192-4ced-af72-4975906e1a00)
The game features three buttons that players can race to press, a blinky LED matrix question selection menu and stop light, a joystick shield to navigate the game, and an LCD display for text. It all runs on a NUCLEO F401RE. 

See the writeup for details.
